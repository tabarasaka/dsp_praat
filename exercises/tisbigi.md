For beat frequencies to occur, the two angular frequencies must be close in value. Mathematically, this condition can be expressed as:

$$
|\omega_1 - \omega_2| \ll \omega_1 + \omega_2.
$$

This implies that the average angular frequency, $\omega_{\text{avg}}$, is approximately equal to $\omega_1$ or $\omega_2$, while the modulation angular frequency, $\omega_{\text{mod}}$, is very small, approaching zero. As a result, the $\cos(\omega_{\text{mod}} t)$ term oscillates very slowly. Combined with the amplitude term $2A$, the product $2A \cos(\omega_{\text{mod}} t)$ provides a slowly varying amplitude for the $\cos(\omega_{\text{avg}} t)$ function.

This implies that the average angular frequency, *ω*<sub>avg</sub>, is approximately equal to *ω*<sub>1</sub> or *ω*<sub>2</sub>, while the modulation angular frequency, *ω*<sub>mod</sub>, is very small, approaching zero. As a result, the cos (*ω*<sub>mod</sub>*t*) term oscillates very slowly. Combined with the amplitude term 2*A*, the product 2*A*cos (*ω*<sub>mod</sub>*t*) provides a slowly varying amplitude for the cos (*ω*<sub>avg</sub>*t*) function.

The beat frequency is found to be twice the modulation frequency, $f_{\text{mod}}$, where:
