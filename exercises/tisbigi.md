This implies that the average angular frequency, `$\omega_{\text{avg}}$`, is approximately equal to `$\omega_1$` or `$\omega_2$`, while the modulation angular frequency, `$\omega_{\text{mod}}$`, is very small, approaching zero. As a result, the `$\cos(\omega_{\text{mod}} t)$` term oscillates very slowly. Combined with the amplitude term `$2A$`, the product `$2A \cos(\omega_{\text{mod}} t)$` provides a slowly varying amplitude for the `$\cos(\omega_{\text{avg}} t)$` function.
