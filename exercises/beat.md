# Exercise 3: Exploring Beat Frequency

## Objective
The goal of this exercise is to explore the phenomenon of beat frequency using stereo sounds in Praat. You will combine sine waves with slightly different frequencies, observe the formation of beats, and investigate how our auditory system perceives these beats differently based on how the sound is created. **There is no submission required; focus on experimenting and understanding.** You are expected to know the basic concept of beat frequencies for your final exam.

## Understanding Beat Frequency
Beat frequencies occur when two sound waves with slightly different frequencies interfere, creating a tone that fluctuates in volume between loud and soft. This fluctuation is known as **beats**. The phenomenon arises from the constructive and destructive interference between the two waves.

When two waves are expressed mathematically as:

```math
x_1 = A \cos(\omega_1 t) \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = A \cos(\omega_2 t),
